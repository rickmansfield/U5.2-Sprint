<!-- The most significant time complexity is the single while loop. worst-case O(n) is linear as is the case with any array. which is dependent upon the size of the list "nums" presented and dictates the number of needed loops through the length. Space complexity is similar The space complexity of an array is linear (O(n)). Each item in the array will take up space in memory. Using hashing helps but we are actually allocating a new list. You might copy all of the items in a slice from the original array into the newly allocated list. This means that you have an O(n) time cost (for the copying) and an O(n) space cost for the newly allocated list. However, The use of this binary search for time complexity is O(log_2n)  irrespective of the element position even if it is not present in the array. In Summary...
Best-case performance	O(1) for most
Average performance	O(log n) for this solution 
Worst-case space complexity O(1) for this solution -->
